# Bank-Test
I am trying to learn java and this is my first project and I had queries regarding what i can do to make it better. This project was build using Netbeans. Apologies if this seems too easy, I am a beginner. I wanted to know how i can make changes to the radio button clicks and how do i setVisible MainScreen false after processing it to the next operating screen.
